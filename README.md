# 🧠 CodeMentor — Adaptive AI Coding Assistant

An AI-powered coding tutor designed to help developers understand, debug, and improve their Python code.  
CodeMentor analyzes your code and message, detects your sentiment, estimates your skill level, measures code complexity, and adapts its explanations, hints, or fixes accordingly.

> 💬 Paste your code → 📊 Analyze sentiment & complexity → 🛠 Get tailored explanations, hints, or automatic fixes.

This project is a **Generative AI application** that combines:

- 🧠 **Sentiment Analysis** (DistilBERT) to detect user frustration or confidence.
- 📈 **Skill Estimation** based on message tone and code complexity.
- 🌳 **AST Analysis** to measure structural depth and logical complexity.
- 🧹 **Ruff Static Analysis** to detect linting and style issues.
- 🧩 **Adaptive Prompt Engineering** to tailor responses based on mode, emotion, and skill.

It offers developers a responsive tool for explanation, debugging support, and guided learning.
